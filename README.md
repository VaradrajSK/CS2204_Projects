Verilog Projects for CS2204

Hii there!

Please go through the .pdf project brief documents. Try and understand the design specifications and come up with the FSM diagram(ProjectD) and the individual module block digrams(ProjectE).
Let me know if I can help with anything or we can sync up over zoom anytime.

Happy coding!
